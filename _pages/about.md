<p>I am an assistant professor of the <a href="http://www.ccse.uestc.edu.cn/">School of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.uestc.edu.cn/">University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)</a>. I joined UESTC in Feb. 2016. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Chinese University of Hong Kong working with Prof. <a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pclee/www/index.html">Patrick P. C. Lee</a>. During Sep. 2013 to Oct. 2014, I was a visiting scholar at Pennsylvania State University working with Prof. <a href="http://asquicciarini.ist.psu.edu/">Anna Squicciarini</a>. I obtained my B.S. from Hebei University of Technology in 2009 and my Ph.D. from Nankai University in 2014 under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://cc.nankai.edu.cn/Teachers/Introduce.aspx?TID=jiacf">Chunfu Jia</a>.</p>

<p>My research interest is to <strong>apply various cryptographic technologies to build encrypted storage systems</strong>, in order to provide secure access interfaces to privacy-preserving applications. I am currently focusing on <strong>secure deduplication</strong>, and exploring its application together with other functionalities including access control, fault tolerance, etc.</p>

<p>I prefer to drive my research based on a combination of <strong>security theory</strong> and <strong>system implementation</strong>. In particular, it emphasises a general framework including formal security definitions, detailed system designs, rigorous security proofs and practical system implementations.</p>
