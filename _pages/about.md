I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science at CU.

My main research interests include
* High performance computing
  * PETSc
* Machine learning / Deep learning
  * Pattern Recognition and Data Mining
  * Information and Complexity
* Computational Mathematics
  * Numerical solutions of PDEs
* Probability and Statistics
  * Statistical Modelings


I am also broadly interested in computational social science, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence.

Current teaching: 
* CSCI 3022: Data Science with Probability and Statistics
* CSCI 1320: Engineer Applications

Here are some Chinese maxims:
* 业精于勤，荒于嬉。行成于思，毁于随。
* 路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索。
