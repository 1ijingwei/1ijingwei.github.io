I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science at CU.

My main research interests include
* Scientific Computing 
* Machine learning/ Deep learning
* Statistical Modelings

I am also broadly interested in computational social science, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence.

Current teaching: 
* CSCI 3022 Intro to Data Science
* CSCI 1320 Engineer Applications.

Here are some Chinese old sayings I want to share with you:
* 业精于勤，荒于嬉。行成于思，毁于随。
* 路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索。
