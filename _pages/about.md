I am an assistant professor of the School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). I joined UESTC in Feb. 2016. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Chinese University of Hong Kong working with Prof. Patrick P. C. Lee. During Sep. 2013 to Oct. 2014, I was a visiting scholar at Pennsylvania State University working with Prof. Anna Squicciarini. I obtained my B.S. from Nanjing University of Technology in 2009 and my Ph.D. from Nankai University in 2014 under the supervision of Prof. Xiaoyang.

My research interest is to apply **various cryptographic technologies** to build encrypted storage systems, in order to provide secure access interfaces to privacy-preserving applications. I am currently focusing on secure deduplication, and exploring its application together with other functionalities including access control, fault tolerance, etc.

I prefer to drive my research based on a combination of security theory and system implementation. In particular, it emphasises a general framework including formal security definitions, detailed system designs, rigorous security proofs and practical system implementations.
