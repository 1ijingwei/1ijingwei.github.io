I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science at CU.

My main research interests include
* High performance computing
* Machine learning / Deep learning
* Statistical Modelings

I am also broadly interested in computational social science, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence.

Current teaching: 
* CSCI 3022: Data Science with Probability and Statistics
* CSCI 1320: Engineer Applications

Here are some Chinese maxims:
* 业精于勤，荒于嬉。行成于思，毁于随。
* 路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索。
