I am originally from P.R.China. I completed my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematitcs at NUFE. After that, I worked in a software company and a state-owned enterprises in Nanjing Presidential Palace.

After have some really social practice, I decided to return to academia to improve my comprehensive skills because I experienced several challenges. Broadly, I am interested in many areas. More specifically, I am interested.

Life is colorful and without certain patterns. I enjoy chinese calligraphy, learning about different cultures and traveling.

Here are some Chinese old sayings I want to share with you:

* 业精于勤，荒于嬉。行成于思，毁于随。

* 路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索。
